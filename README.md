To whom it may concern,

Hello, my name is Quentin-Allen and this is a personal project of mine. Seeing as there is a bit of a hiring freeze due to this unfortunate pandemic, I decided to
work on this project that was recommended to me but the Assistant GM of the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball. This website incorporates the MLB Data API
(https://appac.github.io/mlb-data-api-docs/) and I want to make it a sort of pseudo Baseball Refrence knock off. It is currently a work in progress.
